Israel–Palestine Conflict: Historical Roots and Humanitarian Costs (Ancient Times to 2025)

Introduction

The Israel–Palestine conflict is one of the world’s longest-running and most complex disputes, rooted in ancient history and shaped by a tumultuous 20th century. The land at the eastern edge of the Mediterranean – known variously as Canaan, Palestine, the Holy Land, and now Israel and the Palestinian Territories – holds profound significance for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam ￼ ￼. Over millennia it has seen waves of conquest and exile, fostering deep historical attachments for both Jewish and Arab peoples. In the modern era, these attachments collided amid rising nationalism: the Jewish Zionist movement’s quest for a safe homeland after centuries of persecution, and the Palestinian Arab desire for self-determination in their native land. The resulting conflict has been marked by wars, displacement, and failed peace efforts – and above all by immense humanitarian suffering.

Centered on Human Costs: This report chronicles the conflict from its ancient biblical roots through major 20th-century turning points (the British Mandate, the 1948 Nakba/Israeli independence war, the 1967 Six-Day War, the Oslo peace process) up to the escalations of 2023–2025. Throughout, the focus is on the human toll: the lives disrupted or lost, communities uprooted, children growing up amid trauma, and the impact on basic needs and the environment. It strives to present a balanced, historically grounded narrative, noting how events are remembered from both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives. Where appropriate, more emotive or poetic language is used to convey the profound sorrow and hope that have accompanied this conflict. Ultimately, the story of Israel-Palestine is not only about borders and ideologies, but about ordinary people – Israelis and Palestinians alike – seeking security, justice, and dignity.

(A timeline of key events is provided at the end of the report for reference.) ￼ ￼

Ancient and Early History: A Land of Many Legacies

Biblical Times: The region of Palestine (biblical Canaan) has been inhabited since prehistoric times by various Semitic peoples ￼. According to biblical tradition, around 1000 BCE the Israelite tribes established the Kingdom of Israel in part of this land. Under Kings David and Solomon, Israel ruled from Jerusalem and built the First Temple, forging a Jewish connection to the city ￼. The kingdom later split and fell to imperial conquests: Assyrians overran Israel’s northern tribes, and in 586 BCE Babylonian forces destroyed Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem, exiling the Jews to Babylon ￼. Though a Second Temple was built under Persian and Hellenistic rule (and Jewish inhabitants returned), Roman conquest eventually brought traumatic upheaval. After a Jewish revolt, the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE and, following a second revolt in 135 CE, expelled many Jews and renamed the province “Palestine.” This ushered in a nearly 2,000-year Jewish diaspora, during which Jews maintained spiritual ties to the land even as they lived across Europe, the Middle East, and beyond.

Successive Conquests: Meanwhile, Palestine’s population remained predominantly local Christians and (after the 7th century) Muslims. The land passed through many hands: it was ruled by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire until Arab Muslim conquest in 637 CE, after which it became part of successive Islamic caliphates ￼. Jerusalem, sacred to all three monotheistic faiths, saw the construction of Islam’s Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif, even as Jews prayed toward the last remnant of their Temple (the Western Wall). The Crusades (1099–1291) brought brief Christian rule, but by the 16th century the Ottoman Empire incorporated Palestine. For 400 years of Ottoman rule (1517–1917), the region was a multicultural province where a mostly Arab (Muslim and Christian) population coexisted with a small, long-established Jewish minority ￼ ￼. Jews lived primarily in cities like Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed, and Tiberias; notably, Jerusalem already held profound importance to Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. There was relative communal coexistence under Ottoman governance, but nationalist sentiments had yet to fully emerge.

By the late 19th century, modern nationalism took root. Among European Jews facing pervasive anti-Semitism and pogroms, the Zionist movement (led by figures like Theodor Herzl) arose, advocating a return to Zion (Palestine) to establish a Jewish nation-state. Simultaneously, Palestinian Arabs began developing their own national consciousness, especially as they saw increasing numbers of European Jewish immigrants arriving. On the eve of World War I, Palestine remained under Ottoman control, with Jews comprising perhaps 5–7% of the population and land ownership ￼. But the war and its aftermath would transform the region, sowing the seeds of the current conflict.

The British Mandate and Conflicting Promises (1917–1947)

In 1917, during World War I, Britain captured Palestine from the Ottomans and made conflicting promises regarding the land’s future. On one hand, British officials had corresponded with Arab leaders (the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence) hinting at Arab independence in former Ottoman lands if they revolted against Turkey ￼. At the same time, Britain secretly negotiated the Sykes-Picot Agreement with France, carving the Middle East into colonial spheres – notably excluding Palestine from promised Arab rule ￼. Then in November 1917, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, pledging support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,” while vaguely noting that this should not prejudice the rights of existing non-Jewish communities ￼. This declaration heartened Zionists but alarmed Arab Palestinians, who comprised roughly 90% of the population and feared dispossession.

After WWI, the newly-formed League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate over Palestine (1922), incorporating the Balfour Declaration’s terms. Effectively, Britain was tasked with establishing a Jewish national home without denying political rights to the Arab majority – an inherently contradictory mandate ￼. During the 1920s and 1930s, Jewish immigration to Palestine surged, aided by Zionist institutions and Britain’s acquiescence ￼. The Jewish population rose from about 10% in 1918 to over 30% by 1947 ￼, swelled especially by refugees from Nazi persecution in Europe. “The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven” for Jews in Palestine ￼, and indeed tens of thousands of survivors sought refuge there in the 1940s. Jewish immigrants purchased lands (sometimes displacing tenant fellahin farmers) and built kibbutzim and towns; Palestinian Arabs, for their part, grew increasingly resentful as they saw their homeland’s future being reshaped without their consent.

Tensions between the two communities led to inter-communal violence. Clashes broke out in the early 1920s and again in 1929 – notably the Hebron massacre of 1929, where 67 Jews were killed by Arabs, and reprisal killings of Arabs by militant Jews. British authorities struggled to maintain order. The situation exploded in 1936, when Palestinians launched a major uprising (the Arab Revolt, 1936–1939) against both British rule and Zionist immigration. The revolt included strikes, protests, and guerilla attacks, met by a harsh British crackdown. Over these years, some 5,000 Palestinians were killed in suppression efforts ￼, villages were collectively punished, and key Palestinian leaders were exiled or imprisoned. Seeking a solution, Britain’s Peel Commission in 1937 proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states for the first time. This plan offered a small enclave for Arabs and roughly one-third of the land (including most of the fertile coast) for a Jewish state. Zionist leaders accepted partition in principle but wanted more land, while Palestinian and Arab leaders firmly rejected dividing their country ￼. As violence continued, Britain issued the 1939 White Paper, limiting Jewish immigration and promising an independent unified Palestine (with an Arab majority) within 10 years. This U-turn enraged Zionists (some of whose underground militias then turned to anti-British attacks), but it was too late to appease Palestinian Arabs as well. World War II intervened, and by war’s end the British were exhausted and eager to quit Palestine.

By 1947, Britain announced it would end the Mandate, handing over the question of Palestine’s future to the United Nations. The demographic realities at war’s end were stark: of roughly 1.9 million inhabitants of Mandatory Palestine, about 630,000 were Jews and 1.3 million Arabs ￼. Both communities were determined and distrustful – Jews driven by the imperative of establishing a secure state after the Holocaust, and Arabs intent on asserting their majority rights and preventing what they viewed as a looming foreign colonization. The stage was set for a historic showdown.

1947–49: UN Partition Plan, War, and the Nakba

In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution 181, recommending the partition of Palestine into two states – one Jewish, one Arab – with an internationally-administered Jerusalem. The plan allotted about 55% of the territory to a Jewish state and 45% to an Arab state (reflecting anticipated Jewish immigration), though Jews at that time owned under 10% of the land and were one-third of the population ￼ ￼. Jewish leaders accepted the UN partition proposal as the basis for statehood, but Palestinian Arab leaders and the Arab states rejected it. From the Arab perspective, partition violated the principle of majority rule and awarded a disproportionate share of land to the Jewish state ￼. Communal violence between Jews and Arabs erupted even before the British withdrawal.

On May 14, 1948, Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the independence of the State of Israel, as British forces departed. The very next day, armies from five neighboring Arab countries (Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Iraq, and a token force from Lebanon) intervened, ostensibly to support the Palestinian Arabs and prevent the new Israeli state from expanding ￼ ￼. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War had begun.

The war was hard-fought and often brutal on all sides. Early on, Zionist militias (the Haganah and paramilitary groups like the Irgun and Lehi) secured much of the territory allotted to Israel – and in the process, many Arab towns and villages were captured or emptied. Palestinian Arab society, lacking centralized command, collapsed under the onslaught. In April 1948, the Deir Yassin massacre (when over 100 Arab villagers were killed by Irgun/Lehi fighters) spread panic among Palestinians, while Arab irregulars retaliated by ambushing Jewish convoys (e.g. the Hadassah medical convoy massacre) ￼. As the Israeli military (forming out of the Haganah) pushed back the invading Arab armies through 1948 and into 1949, over half of Palestine’s Arab population was displaced. By war’s end, some 750,000 Palestinians – men, women, and children – had fled or were expelled from their homes ￼ ￼. At least 15,000 Palestinians were killed in the fighting, including civilians ￼. About 531 Palestinian villages and urban neighborhoods were deliberately destroyed or depopulated during this period, erasing many communities from the map ￼. Palestinians refer to this mass displacement and destruction as al-Nakba – Arabic for “the Catastrophe” – an event of collective trauma that remains central to their national memory.

From the Israeli perspective, the 1948 War (the War of Independence) was an almost miraculous survival story. The newly declared Israeli state, with around 650,000 Jews, faced the armies of five Arab nations and local Arab militias. Israel suffered around 6,000 fatalities (about 1% of its population) in the war ￼ ￼, including civilians killed in sieges or massacres. Jewish residents of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem’s Old City were expelled by Jordan’s Arab Legion, and mixed cities like Jerusalem and Haifa saw painful upheavals. Yet by early 1949, Israel had defeated the Arab forces on most fronts. Through armistice agreements, Israel expanded beyond the UN partition lines, controlling approximately 78% of historic Palestine (about 20% more territory than the UN plan had allotted) ￼. The remaining 22% – the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip – came under the control of Jordan and Egypt, respectively ￼. No Arab Palestinian state was established; instead, Jordan annexed the West Bank (granting Jordanian citizenship to its Arab residents) and Egypt administered Gaza (without integrating its population).

For Palestinians, the aftermath of 1948 was devastating. Three-quarters of a million Palestinian refugees found themselves in exile: crammed into Gaza (which saw its population triple), dispersed to Jordan’s East Bank, Lebanon, Syria, or farther abroad. Many ended up in hastily organized refugee camps under the care of the newly formed U.N. agency UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency). They expected to return home when the war ended – but Israel barred the return of refugees, seizing their abandoned properties and razing many villages ￼ ￼. Today these refugees and their descendants number about 5.9 million registered with the UN, making up one of the world’s longest-standing refugee populations ￼. They and their descendants have lived for decades in camps or as second-class residents in Arab states, holding on to deeds and rusty keys from homes in what is now Israel, and asserting a “right of return” that remains a core demand of the Palestinian cause ￼.

Amid this upheaval, the Jewish state of Israel emerged. Roughly 800,000 Jews from Arab countries would migrate to Israel over the next two decades – many expelled or driven by persecution in retaliation for the Palestinian exodus ￼. In a sense, a two-way refugee flow occurred: as hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs left Israeli-held territory, hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees from Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Morocco, Libya and other Middle Eastern countries arrived in Israel ￼. Israel’s population doubled in its first years, including impoverished Jewish newcomers hastily settled in empty Palestinian homes. While Israel integrated these Jewish refugees as citizens, Palestinians languished as refugees with unresolved status. Both peoples felt a profound sense of loss and victimhood – Israelis at the huge sacrifice to secure their state in the shadow of the Holocaust, and Palestinians at the dispossession of their homeland in the Nakba. This dual tragedy set the stage for the conflict’s next phases, as Palestinians struggled to reclaim their rights and Israelis fought to defend their hard-won sovereignty.

The Post-1948 Order and Early Conflicts (1949–1967)

The two decades after the 1948 war saw an uneasy status quo. There was no peace treaty – only armistice lines (the “Green Line”) separating Israel from its Arab neighbors. These 1949 armistice lines left Israel in control of all of Galilee, the coastal plains, and the Negev desert up to the former Egypt–Palestine border. Jordan held the West Bank and East Jerusalem (including the Old City’s holy sites), while Egypt held the Gaza Strip. Jerusalem was divided by barbed wire; Jews were barred from their holy sites under Jordanian rule, and Palestinians were separated from family members across the lines. No Arab state recognized Israel, and no compensation or return was offered to Palestinian refugees, fueling Arab bitterness. Cross-border fedayeen attacks and Israeli reprisal raids punctuated the 1950s. In one notorious 1953 incident, an elite Israeli unit led by Ariel Sharon attacked the West Bank village of Qibya, blowing up dozens of homes and killing 69 Palestinian civilians ￼. Such raids, and Palestinian guerrilla infiltrations from Gaza and the West Bank, perpetuated a cycle of violence.

Regionally, the Arab states – notably Egypt under President Gamal Abdel Nasser – championed the Palestinian cause rhetorically, but often kept the refugees in camps under tight control. In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded (with Arab League backing) to represent the Palestinian people. Initially led by Ahmed Shukeiri, the PLO charter called for liberating all of Palestine (through armed struggle) and denying Israel’s legitimacy. However, through the 1950s and 60s, Palestinians remained largely politically marginalized, with Egypt and Jordan making decisions regarding Gaza and the West Bank. Many young Palestinians grew restless and began forming independent fedayeen groups, like Fatah (founded by Yasser Arafat and others in the late 1950s).

Meanwhile, Israel focused on state-building. It established governmental institutions, absorbed waves of immigrants (including Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab lands), and fortified its military (the Israel Defense Forces, IDF). But the sense of isolation remained, as hostile Arab armies encircled it. In 1956, Israel briefly went to war alongside Britain and France against Egypt (the Suez Crisis) after Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal. In that war, Israel invaded and occupied the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip, defeating Egyptian forces, but under U.S. and Soviet pressure Israel withdrew in 1957 (with U.N. peacekeepers deployed to Sinai/Gaza). The Suez Crisis deepened Arab resolve and elevated Nasser’s prestige, but it was a preview of bigger conflicts to come.

By 1967, tensions were sky-high. Border skirmishes were frequent; Israel and Syria clashed over the demilitarized zones and water access, and Palestinian guerrillas (often backed by Syria) attacked Israel from Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian territory, prompting Israeli reprisals. Egypt’s Nasser, under pressure to act on his pan-Arab rhetoric, moved to militarily support Syria. In May 1967 Egypt expelled U.N. peacekeepers from Sinai, blockaded Israel’s access to the Red Sea (Straits of Tiran), and rallied Arab states in a defensive alliance. Israel, feeling an existential threat as Arab armies mobilized, decided on a preemptive strike – igniting the Six-Day War.

The Six-Day War of 1967: Occupation of Palestinian Territories

In June 1967, Israel launched a stunning preemptive air assault that decimated the air forces of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. In just six days of war (June 5–10, 1967), Israel defeated the armies of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, seizing a vast amount of territory ￼. This conflict, known to Israelis as the Six-Day War and to Palestinians (and Arabs) as the Naksa (“the setback”), dramatically altered the map and the conflict’s dynamics. Israel captured:
	•	East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan,
	•	Gaza Strip and Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, and
	•	Golan Heights from Syria ￼.

For Palestinians, the entire remainder of historic Palestine fell under Israeli control. What had been the Jordanian-controlled West Bank and Egyptian-controlled Gaza – home to over one million Palestinian Arabs – were now Israeli-occupied territories. An additional 300,000 Palestinians fled or were displaced in 1967’s war, many of them 1948 refugees uprooted for a second time ￼. Cities like Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, Jericho, Gaza, and others came under Israeli military occupation. Israel swiftly annexed East Jerusalem, declaring the unified city its eternal capital (a move not recognized by the U.N. or most countries) ￼ ￼. The rest of the West Bank and Gaza were placed under Israeli military administration. Palestinians in these territories suddenly found themselves living under foreign military rule – subject to checkpoints, curfews, and land seizures – a stark new reality that continues (in the West Bank and East Jerusalem) to this day.

The territorial gains greatly expanded Israel’s size and strategic depth, but also brought over a million stateless Palestinians under Israeli rule, posing a dilemma: Israel did not annex the West Bank/Gaza (aside from Jerusalem), but it also refused to withdraw without peace treaties, which Arab states initially refused to consider. The U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 242 in November 1967, calling for Israel’s withdrawal from territories occupied in the war in exchange for peace and mutual recognition. This resolution introduced the principle of “land for peace,” which remains a foundation for all subsequent peace efforts ￼. Israel, however, was hesitant to fully relinquish these lands without direct negotiations.

In the war’s aftermath, Israel began establishing settlements in the occupied territories – initially in strategic areas and around Jerusalem. Especially after 1977, this grew into a full-scale policy: the government incentivized Israeli Jews to move into the West Bank and Gaza, often on confiscated Palestinian land, citing historical/biblical claims and security needs. To Palestinians, these settlements were (and are) seen as illegal land grabs aimed at preventing a future Palestinian state. Indeed, the international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (which prohibits moving civilian population into occupied land) ￼ ￼. Today there are about 150 Israeli settlements in the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), housing roughly 700,000 Israeli settlers ￼. These settlements, with their exclusive roads and military protection, fragment the West Bank and have been a continuous source of tension and violence.

Jerusalem became a focal point post-1967: Israel’s annexation and extension of sovereignty over East Jerusalem brought its Jewish, Christian, and Islamic holy sites under Israeli control, but also created a Palestinian Arab population in the city with a precarious status (most have Israeli residency but not citizenship) ￼ ￼. Both peoples claim Jerusalem as their capital, making it one of the most intractable issues. The Old City’s sacred compound – known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary, home to Al-Aqsa Mosque) and to Jews as the Temple Mount – remains an emotional flashpoint where any perceived change to the status quo can trigger violence ￼ ￼.

On the broader stage, the Arabs’ defeat in 1967 spurred significant changes. The war discredited pan-Arab leaders like Nasser (who died in 1970) and fueled independent Palestinian nationalism. The PLO, now led by Yasser Arafat (who took command of the organization’s largest faction, Fatah), increasingly asserted Palestinian decision-making. The PLO relocated its base to Jordan and then, after clashes with the Jordanian army in 1970 (Black September), to Lebanon. In 1974 the Arab League recognized the PLO as the “sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people,” and the U.N. granted the PLO observer status. Palestinian fedayeen carried out hijackings and attacks to draw world attention – most notoriously the 1972 Munich Olympics attack (by the faction Black September) which killed 11 Israeli athletes. Israel retaliated with operations against PLO bases in Lebanon and assassinations of militants abroad.

Meanwhile, Israel and Arab states gradually moved toward a state-centric conflict rather than an absolute refusal to coexist. After another war in 1973 (the Yom Kippur or October War, in which Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack to regain lost territories – leading to fierce battles and heavy casualties on both sides), a diplomatic path opened. In 1979, Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty – the Camp David Accords – by which Israel returned the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for full peace and normalization ￼ ￼. This removed Egypt (the Arab world’s largest military) from the conflict and affirmed the “land for peace” principle. However, the treaty pointedly did not resolve the Palestinian issue; it only included vague commitments to future autonomy talks for the “Palestinian territories.” Other Arab states and the PLO condemned Egypt’s separate peace, and Egypt was briefly ostracized in the Arab world.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, no Palestinian state emerged, and Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza deepened. Palestinians in those territories lived under military curfews and emergency laws; land was confiscated for settlements; and acts of resistance (even displaying a Palestinian flag or organizing political groups) were criminalized. Israeli forces and the internal security service (Shin Bet) suppressed dissent; torture and collective punishments were reported by rights groups. Jewish settlers in the territories, often ideologically driven by religious/Zionist claims, at times harassed Palestinian residents or took vigilante action, further exacerbating tensions. It was a powder keg – and in 1987, it ignited.

The First Intifada (1987–1993): Uprising and the Oslo Peace Hopes

On December 9, 1987, a spontaneous Palestinian uprising erupted in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza after an Israeli military truck collided with a car of Palestinian laborers, killing four ￼ ￼. This incident was the spark in a long-festering tinderbox of frustration. Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – especially a generation that had grown up under twenty years of occupation – rose up in mass protests, civil disobedience, and occasional violence against Israeli military rule. This uprising became known as the First Intifada (Arabic for “shaking off”). It was characterized by grassroots mobilization: youth throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at Israeli troops, commercial strikes, graffiti and leaflet campaigns, and the formation of popular committees. Israel, caught off-guard by the largely unarmed revolt, responded with force. Troops used tear gas, live ammunition, and a controversial “broken bones” policy (soldiers were documented beating protesters with clubs to literally break their limbs as a deterrent) ￼ ￼. Images of young Palestinians facing off against one of the world’s most advanced armies drew international attention and sympathy.

Over roughly six years (1987–1993), the First Intifada took a heavy human toll. More than 1,000 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during the uprising, including many teenagers and children; most were killed in protests and clashes, and some were targeted leaders ￼ ￼. On the Israeli side, over 100 Israelis (civilians and soldiers) were killed by Palestinians during the Intifada ￼ ￼ – some by stones or Molotovs in riots, others in stabbing or shooting attacks often carried out by militants outside the control of the main uprising leadership. The asymmetry of casualties (roughly 10 Palestinians killed for every Israeli) underscored the conflict’s imbalance of power. Beyond the fatalities, thousands more were injured, and an entire generation of Palestinians endured arrests (Israel detained tens of thousands, including children), beatings, curfews, and economic hardship as the territories were sealed off ￼. For Israeli soldiers – many doing compulsory service – the Intifada was a sobering experience of policing civilian protests and facing moral dilemmas in the occupied territories.

The Intifada was a people’s movement, not orchestrated by the distant PLO leadership (which was then based in exile in Tunis). Local activists, under an umbrella called the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, coordinated much of the protest. However, Islamist groups also gained prominence – notably Hamas, founded in 1987 in Gaza as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas rejected the PLO’s secular nationalism and focused on Islamic ideology and armed resistance; during the Intifada it built support through grassroots charity networks and by portraying itself as uncompromising in fighting Israel.

Internationally, the Intifada changed the narrative. The sight of youth throwing stones against occupying soldiers, and mothers clashing with military jeeps in narrow alleys, forced the world to acknowledge the Palestinian quest for freedom under occupation. The United States, under President George H.W. Bush, convened the Madrid Conference in 1991, bringing Israelis and Arab representatives (including a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation) to the table for the first time. Meanwhile, the PLO – which had faced isolation after backing Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf War – reconsidered its approach. In 1988, Yasser Arafat and the PLO formally recognized the State of Israel (implicitly accepting a two-state solution) and renounced terrorism, in hopes of gaining a diplomatic opening.

These moves paved the way for a breakthrough: secret negotiations in Oslo, Norway. In 1993, after months of clandestine talks, Israeli government representatives and the PLO reached an agreement that stunned the world. On September 13, 1993, on the White House lawn, Yitzhak Rabin (Israel’s Prime Minister) and Yasser Arafat (PLO Chairman) shook hands before U.S. President Bill Clinton – a moment of hope symbolizing mutual recognition ￼ ￼. They signed the Oslo Accords (the Declaration of Principles), launching a peace process aimed at resolving the conflict. Under Oslo, the PLO formally recognized Israel’s right to exist in peace, and Israel recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people ￼. The accords laid out a five-year timetable for negotiations on final status issues (borders, Jerusalem, refugees, settlements), and in the interim, partial self-governance for Palestinians.

Under Oslo’s framework, the Palestinian Authority (PA) was established in 1994 to administer areas of the West Bank and Gaza from which Israel would gradually withdraw. Initially, major Palestinian population centers (Ramallah, Nablus, Gaza City, etc.) gained PA control, while Israel maintained authority over most settlements and the entirety of East Jerusalem. The Palestinians gained limited autonomy – their own police, schools, and ministries – a significant change after 27 years of direct occupation. For a time, optimism blossomed: Rabin and Arafat (along with Israeli FM Shimon Peres) won the Nobel Peace Prize; polls showed majorities on each side supported peace; and economic activity picked up under the banner of a coming “New Middle East.”

Yet deep mutual suspicions and opposition festered beneath the surface. Extremists on both sides derided Oslo as a betrayal. Some Palestinian factions – Hamas and Islamic Jihad – rejected the accords outright, seeing them as a surrender of the goal to liberate all of Palestine occupied in 1948 ￼. They intensified militant attacks, including a wave of suicide bombings targeting Israeli buses, cafes, and public areas in the mid-1990s, killing scores of civilians. These attacks sowed fear and anger in Israel, undermining faith in the peace process. On the Israeli side, hardline settlers and nationalist opponents saw Oslo as “giving in to terrorism” and risking Israel’s security and biblical birthright. In February 1994, a Jewish extremist (Baruch Goldstein) massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in Hebron’s Ibrahimi Mosque, aiming to derail peace. The violence threatened to become a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.

Tragically, on November 4, 1995, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin – the former general who had traded his “sword for plowshares” – was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist opposed to the accords. Rabin’s death was a severe blow to the peace camp. Though Shimon Peres took over and continued negotiations (achieving a follow-up Oslo II agreement that divided the West Bank into Areas A, B, C with varying control), the momentum slowed. In 1996, Benjamin Netanyahu of the right-wing Likud party (an Oslo skeptic) was elected Israeli PM, partly on a wave of security fears after more suicide bombings. The trust between the sides frayed as each accused the other of bad faith – Israel continued expanding settlements even during the peace process ￼, and the newly formed Palestinian Authority struggled (or, some say, failed) to rein in militant attacks. By 2000, the lofty hopes of Oslo remained unfulfilled: no final peace treaty had been reached, and critical issues like Jerusalem, refugees, borders, and settlements were as contentious as ever.

The Second Intifada (2000–2005): Violence and Despair

In September 2000, a new uprising – the Second Intifada – erupted, shattering the remnants of the Oslo peace hopes. The trigger was a provocative visit by Ariel Sharon (then an opposition politician, later Prime Minister) to Jerusalem’s al-Aqsa compound/Temple Mount, accompanied by hundreds of Israeli police. Palestinians saw this as a challenge to their claims in East Jerusalem. Protests around Al-Aqsa quickly escalated as Israeli forces used live fire and Palestinians responded with stones and later gunfire. The unrest spread across the West Bank and Gaza. This Second Intifada (also called the Al-Aqsa Intifada) was far more violent and militarized than the first ￼.

Palestinian militants, including Tanzim (Fatah’s youth militia), Hamas, and Islamic Jihad, engaged in armed attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli targets, even inside Israel. Cafés, buses, nightclubs – no venue was immune from the horrific bombings that killed and maimed Israeli civilians in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, and other cities. Between 2000 and 2005, over 1,000 Israelis were killed, the majority of them civilians murdered in such terror attacks ￼ ￼. The Israeli public lived in fear of riding a bus or gathering in public, and terms like “homicide bomber” and “security fence” became part of daily life. On the other side, the Israeli military responded with overwhelming force in the occupied territories, reoccupying cities that had been handed to PA control, and launching assassinations of militant leaders (e.g. Hamas’s spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, killed by an airstrike in 2004). More than 3,000 Palestinians were killed in these five years ￼ – militants but also a very large number of civilians caught in firefights, targeted in error, or killed in demonstrations. The fighting was intense: Israel sent tanks and warplanes into West Bank towns during Operation Defensive Shield (2002) after a particularly deadly suicide bombing, leading to battles like the one in Jenin. It laid siege to Yasser Arafat’s compound in Ramallah, confining the Palestinian leader for years until his death in 2004 (amid rumors of poisoning).

The Second Intifada’s fatalities exceeded 4,300 in total, with a ratio of a bit over 3 Palestinians killed for every 1 Israeli ￼. This included around approximately 700–1,000 Israeli deaths (mostly civilians, plus security forces) and about 3,000+ Palestinian deaths (about one-third of whom were believed to be combatants) ￼. It was an ugly, bitter conflict that entrenched hatred and mistrust. The humanitarian impacts were severe: Israeli cities experienced trauma and loss from terror attacks, while Palestinian towns endured curfews, closures, widespread destruction of infrastructure, and economic strangulation. The Palestinian economy collapsed under strict Israeli closures – unemployment and poverty skyrocketed. In the occupied territories, mobility was paralyzed by checkpoints and roadblocks; medical emergencies often could not get through. Both societies were traumatized: Israeli families grieved victims of bombs and shootings; Palestinian families mourned those killed by shelling or live fire, and thousands of Palestinian homes were bulldozed (especially in places like Rafah and Nablus) as Israel hunted militants.

The Second Intifada also shattered the Oslo framework. Trust between the sides hit rock bottom. In 2001, hardliner Ariel Sharon was elected Israel’s Prime Minister on a pledge to suppress the Intifada; he pointedly declared the Oslo process dead. On the Palestinian side, the uprising elevated Hamas’s popularity due to its attacks on Israel, while the corruption and ineffectiveness of the PA under Arafat were exposed. Israel accused Arafat of fostering terror (despite his denials), and effectively boycotted him. Eventually, amid international pressure for reform, Arafat agreed to appoint Mahmoud Abbas as a Prime Minister, but power struggles ensued. When Yasser Arafat died in November 2004, it marked the end of an era for Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) succeeded Arafat as PLO chairman and PA president, campaigning on ending armed uprising and negotiating for peace.

By early 2005, the Intifada violence subsided. The toll on children and civilians had been immense on both sides. A survey later found that almost half of Israeli pre-teens in hard-hit town Sderot showed PTSD symptoms from the rocket barrages ￼, while over half of Palestinian children in the conflict zones had trauma-related stress disorders ￼. Psychological scars were everywhere. The “peace process” was in ruins – but paradoxically, some new realities emerged that would shape the next stage.

One was Israel’s unilateral “disengagement” from Gaza. In 2005, Ariel Sharon – now Prime Minister – decided to withdraw all Israeli troops and settlements from the Gaza Strip, ostensibly to reduce friction and demographic burden. Despite opposition from settlers, by September 2005 Israel evacuated about 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza and dismantled its military installations there. The 18-year Israeli occupation of Gaza (since 1967) ostensibly ended. However, Israel retained control over Gaza’s airspace, coast, and border crossings (except Rafah crossing with Egypt, where European monitors and Egyptian officials took positions). The Gaza pullout was a contentious move: Israel’s public was divided (some saw it as relinquishing land to “terrorists,” others as a necessary step for security), and Palestinians had mixed feelings (celebrating an end to settlements in Gaza, but also suspecting Israel was entrenching its hold on the West Bank instead).

Another development was Palestinian political division. In January 2006, Hamas won a surprise victory in Palestinian legislative elections, capitalizing on public discontent with Fatah/PA corruption and the narrative that armed resistance had forced Israel out of Gaza. Hamas’s charter still called for Israel’s destruction, and it refused to recognize Israel or renounce violence. Its win led to a standoff: Israel, the U.S., and EU cut off aid to the PA government under Hamas, demanding it accept prior agreements and recognize Israel ￼. Tensions simmered between Hamas and the Fatah-led PA. In June 2007, this exploded into a brief Palestinian civil war in Gaza: Hamas fighters routed Fatah forces and seized full control of the Gaza Strip ￼. President Mahmoud Abbas then dissolved the Hamas-led government and consolidated an emergency PA administration in the West Bank. Since 2007, the Palestinians have been politically split: Hamas rules Gaza, while the Fatah-dominated PA governs parts of the West Bank.

This schism had profound humanitarian implications. After Hamas’s Gaza takeover, Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza – severely restricting the movement of people and goods in and out of the Strip – citing security concerns (particularly to stop arms smuggling to Hamas). The blockade, which continues to this day (albeit with varying intensity), has strangled Gaza’s economy and contributes to what the U.N. has called “de-development.” The U.N. warned as early as 2012 that Gaza could become uninhabitable by 2020 if trends continued ￼, given the collapsing infrastructure under blockade. By 2017, the U.N. said conditions were deteriorating even faster than anticipated ￼. Indeed, Gaza’s 2 million residents face severe shortages of clean water (the coastal aquifer is polluted and overdrawn ￼), daily electricity blackouts, and high unemployment. Over 80% of Gaza’s population depends on international aid. The humanitarian situation there has been dire, with U.N. and human rights groups frequently calling the blockade collective punishment. Israel argues that the restrictions are necessary to contain Hamas (which has imported rockets and built tunnels for attacks). Caught in between are Gaza’s civilians – a majority of whom are children under 18 and refugees from 1948 – who have endured cycle after cycle of conflict.

Cycles of Conflict in Gaza and Stalemate in the West Bank (2005–2020)

After the Second Intifada, large-scale confrontations shifted primarily to Gaza, while the West Bank saw an entrenched occupation with sporadic violence. Key episodes include:
	•	2006–2007: Cross-border tensions from Gaza continued after the Israeli pullout. In June 2006, Hamas militants captured an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, in a cross-border raid ￼, leading to Israeli military incursions. In 2007, after Hamas took control of Gaza, Israel declared Gaza a “hostile entity.”
	•	December 2008 – January 2009: After rocket fire from Gaza escalated, Israel launched Operation Cast Lead, a 22-day military offensive against Hamas in Gaza ￼. The war wreaked massive destruction in densely populated Gaza. About 1,400 Palestinians were killed (including hundreds of civilians), and 13 Israelis were killed (10 soldiers – some by friendly fire – and 3 civilians from rocket fire) ￼. Whole neighborhoods of Gaza were flattened; over 4,000 buildings including homes were destroyed. A U.N. fact-finding mission (the Goldstone Report) later alleged both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes – Israel for indiscriminate force and targeting civilian infrastructure, and Hamas for firing rockets indiscriminately at Israeli civilian areas. The war’s images – collapsed schools, wounded children, and terrified families – underscored Gaza’s vulnerability and the severe imbalance in casualties. Israel argued it had no choice but to stop Hamas rockets; Palestinians noted the vastly higher Palestinian death toll and accused Israel of disproportionate force.
	•	November 2012: After periodic flare-ups, another brief conflict erupted (Operation Pillar of Defense) when Israel killed a top Hamas military commander. In 8 days of fighting, around 160 Palestinians and 6 Israelis were killed, before an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.
	•	July–August 2014: The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens in the West Bank (by a rogue Hamas cell) and the revenge killing of a Palestinian teen set off a chain reaction leading to the 2014 Gaza War (Operation Protective Edge). Hamas and other groups significantly increased rocket fire at Israeli cities, and even used tunnels to attack Israeli territory. Israel invaded Gaza, resulting in a devastating 7-week war. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed – the U.N. assessed around 1,500 were civilians, including over 500 children – and 73 Israelis were killed (67 soldiers in combat and 6 civilians from rockets/mortars) ￼. Massive Israeli bombardment reduced entire districts (like Shujaiya in Gaza City and parts of Rafah and Khan Younis) to rubble. An estimated 18,000 housing units were destroyed or severely damaged in Gaza, leaving over 100,000 people homeless ￼. Each side accused the other of horrific conduct: Israel blamed Hamas for embedding fighters in civilian areas and using “human shields,” while Palestinians and human rights groups condemned Israel for indiscriminate shelling (including noted incidents like strikes near U.N. schools sheltering civilians). By war’s end, Gaza’s already fragile infrastructure – electricity, water, sanitation – was in shambles. A U.N. inquiry again pointed to possible war crimes by both sides.

Throughout these Gaza wars, Israeli civilians lived under threat of rockets that, while mostly intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, caused panic, disruption, and some fatalities. Border communities like Sderot endured frequent alarms and had mere seconds to seek shelter from incoming projectiles. Studies found extremely high trauma rates – over 75% of children in Sderot showed signs of PTSD and severe anxiety due to the relentless rocket sirens and explosions ￼ ￼. For Israelis, these rocket attacks, though far less lethal than Israeli airstrikes, created a psychological atmosphere of siege. Conversely, Gazans, with no bomb shelters or sirens, lived with the knowledge that at any moment a missile or shell could strike their apartment building or a drone could target a nearby street, with nowhere safe to flee within the sealed Strip.
	•	2018: In the Gaza periphery, desperate civilians launched the Great March of Return protests. Starting March 2018, weekly mass demonstrations by unarmed Gazans took place along the Israeli fence, calling attention to the refugee right of return and Gaza’s humanitarian plight. Some protesters attempted to breach the fence or threw stones and Molotovs. Israeli snipers, positioned on the other side, used live ammunition to prevent any infiltration. Over several months, more than 170 Palestinian protesters (including children, medics, journalists) were killed and thousands wounded by Israeli fire ￼. Israel maintained it was defending its border; U.N. observers noted most protesters were at a distance and posed no imminent lethal threat when shot. The scale of indiscriminate live fire drew international condemnation. One infamous day in May 2018 (coinciding with the U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem), over 60 Gazans were killed in a single day of protests. These events further highlighted the humanitarian crisis and sense of immobility for Gaza’s population, 70% of whom are refugees living under blockade.

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, the situation was one of stalemate and slow burn. The Palestinian Authority under Abbas continued to coordinate with Israel on security (to contain Hamas and maintain order), even as settlement expansion and land confiscation for Israeli roads continued. Periodic peace negotiations were attempted (e.g. the 2013–14 U.S.-brokered talks led by Secretary of State John Kerry) but collapsed over disagreements on settlements, borders, and Israel’s demand that Palestinians recognize it as a “Jewish state.” The number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank swelled year by year, further entrenching Israeli presence. Palestinians in West Bank Areas A and B had limited self-rule in their cities, but Israel controlled Area C (about 60% of the land, including key agricultural areas and the Jordan Valley). The separation barrier (or wall) that Israel built during the Second Intifada – which snakes inside the West Bank, ostensibly to stop suicide bombers – has now been in place for roughly 20 years, cutting off many Palestinians from their farms, jobs, and families. Restrictions on movement (permits, checkpoints) remain a daily reality, especially for the roughly 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank ￼. Israeli military raids in West Bank towns (to arrest militants or demolish homes of attackers) happen frequently, sometimes sparking armed clashes or stone-throwing protests. For instance, in 2023, before the Gaza war, Israeli forces had already killed over 200 Palestinians in the West Bank – the deadliest year in that territory since the Second Intifada – amid near-daily raids in places like Nablus and Jenin. Jewish settler violence towards Palestinian villagers also reached record highs, with attacks on farms and villages often carried out with impunity or even army protection. The U.N. labeled 2023 “a year of unprecedented violence” in the West Bank, compounding Palestinians’ despair at the absence of a peace horizon.

Diplomatically, the two-state solution that was the centerpiece of the Oslo Accords appears ever more elusive. As of mid-2024, 143 U.N. member states recognize the State of Palestine (declared symbolically by the PLO in 1988) in some capacity, yet there is no sovereign Palestinian state on the ground ￼ ￼. Israel’s government – especially the right-wing coalitions in power in recent years – explicitly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state ￼ ￼. In 2020, the Trump administration in the U.S. proposed a “Peace to Prosperity” plan heavily favoring Israeli positions; Palestinians rejected it outright. Instead of a negotiated settlement, facts on the ground – expanding settlements, continued occupation, and deepening resentment – have defined the reality. Some analysts began warning that the situation was sliding into a de facto one-state reality of unequal rights (with comparisons to apartheid, as groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International alleged in reports). This status quo is volatile, and indeed, events would soon prove it unsustainable.

2023–2025: The Most Violent Escalation and a Humanitarian Catastrophe

On October 7, 2023, the conflict entered one of its darkest chapters. In a surprise pre-dawn assault, the Islamist militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack out of Gaza – breaching Israel’s fortified border fences, firing thousands of rockets, and sending teams of fighters into Israeli towns and kibbutzim near Gaza. They attacked Israeli civilians with shocking brutality – going house to house, massacring men, women, and children, and taking scores of hostages. It was the deadliest single day in Israel’s history: at least 1,139 people in Israel were killed in the onslaught ￼, the vast majority civilians slaughtered in their homes, at a music festival, and on the roads. This included women and children (entire families were wiped out), as well as some 300 soldiers and police who died trying to fight the attackers or were caught in bases. Hamas and allied militants abducted around 200 Israeli and foreign hostages back into Gaza – among them elderly grandparents, young children, and even babies. The sheer scale and cruelty of the Hamas attack – often described by Israelis as a “pogrom” or terrorist massacre – sent shockwaves through Israel and the world. Israelis, long feeling relatively secure behind high-tech fences and the Iron Dome, experienced a collective trauma and outrage.

Israel’s response was swift and ferocious. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel was “at war” and vowed to destroy Hamas. The Israeli Air Force began a massive bombing campaign across the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas infrastructure, leadership, and rocket launch sites. Siege conditions were imposed: Israel cut off electricity, fuel, food, and water supplies to Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, saying “no mercy” as long as Hamas held hostages. Within days, thousands of Gazan civilians were dead or wounded under relentless bombardment of residential districts. Israel amassed ground forces and in late October launched a ground invasion into Gaza, battling Hamas fighters in dense urban areas like Beit Hanoun, Gaza City, and later Khan Younis. The war continued for months, far longer and more intense than previous Gaza conflicts.

The humanitarian toll in Gaza was catastrophic. By January 2025, after 15 months of war, an interim ceasefire was reached – leaving a scene of near-total devastation. According to Palestinian health authorities and U.N. agencies, over 60,000 Palestinians in Gaza were killed in the war ￼. This included an estimated 17,000+ children among the dead ￼ – a staggering loss of young life. An additional 14,000+ people were missing and presumed dead under the rubble ￼ ￼. Entire neighborhoods in Gaza City’s north (such as Shujaiya, Jabalia camp, and areas around Al-Shifa hospital) were razed by airstrikes and artillery. The U.N. reported massive damage to infrastructure: by mid-January 2025, Israeli attacks had damaged or destroyed almost every home in Gaza, 80% of all commercial buildings, 88% of schools, half of the hospitals, two-thirds of water and electricity networks, and over two-thirds of Gaza’s cropland ￼. Essentially, Gaza was bombed back decades – a man-made humanitarian disaster.

The war also displaced virtually everyone in Gaza. The Israeli military ordered civilians to evacuate from one area to another as operations shifted; by the peak of fighting, about 80% of Gaza’s population was internally displaced from their homes ￼. U.N. shelters overflowed, forcing families to live in make-shift tents or the ruins of buildings with little access to clean water or medical care. Hospitals struggled desperately – many were damaged or cut off by fighting. Images of premature babies being evacuated from incubators due to power cuts, and doctors performing surgeries by flashlight, epitomized the crisis. The U.N. and humanitarian organizations pleaded for pauses to deliver aid and prevent mass starvation. Fuel shortages crippled generators and water pumps; Gaza’s main power plant was out of action, plunging the enclave into darkness most hours. By the end, Gaza’s tiny territory had become a horrific tableau of rubble, grief, and despair – “hell on earth” as some U.N. officials described it.

Israel’s stated aim was to destroy Hamas’s military capabilities and rescue the hostages. In the course of the war, roughly 400 Israeli soldiers were killed in the ground fighting (according to Israeli media reports), and some 240 hostages were eventually released or recovered – many through mediation by Qatar and Egypt, some tragically found dead. Hamas’s top leaders largely survived (being abroad or in bunkers), but thousands of its fighters were killed and its tunnel networks and arsenals were heavily damaged. Israel pushed Hamas out of northern Gaza and by early 2025 controlled much of the territory militarily, but low-level resistance continued.

The war’s political and moral repercussions were worldwide. International observers and U.N. experts accused both Hamas and Israel of grave breaches of international humanitarian law. Hamas was condemned for the massacre of civilians on Oct 7 and for holding hostages (a war crime). Israel faced condemnation for indiscriminate bombardment in one of the most densely populated places on earth, effectively treating all of north Gaza as a battlefield despite tens of thousands of civilians remaining. Strikes on convoys of fleeing civilians, on apartment blocks, schools, markets, and on hospitals – notably the deadly explosions near Al-Ahli Hospital in October and direct hits on Al-Shifa Hospital complex in November – drew global outrage. By some estimates, 70% of those killed in Gaza were women and children ￼, raising questions of proportionality and distinction (core laws-of-war principles). The U.N. Secretary-General decried the “epic suffering” in Gaza and repeatedly urged a humanitarian ceasefire. Protests erupted worldwide, with many accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians, while others emphasized Israel’s right to self-defense and pinned the blame solely on Hamas for using civilians as shields. The narrative divide was stark – but the humanitarian consensus was that the scale of civilian death and suffering in Gaza was unacceptable.

In the occupied West Bank, the war years of 2023–2024 also saw surging violence. With Israeli forces focused on Gaza, settler attacks on Palestinian villages skyrocketed, often with tacit support from far-right elements in Israel’s government. The Israeli army also carried out intensified raids against suspected militants in West Bank towns, given fears the war could spread. Since October 2023, at least 905 Palestinians (including 180+ children) were killed in the West Bank as of early 2025 ￼ – a mix of militants in gunfights, protesters shot during demonstrations, and victims of settler violence. On the Israeli side, Palestinians carried out several stabbing and car-ramming attacks; in one case, a shooting by a Palestinian gunman in Jerusalem killed multiple Israelis. The war inflamed passions and pushed any prospect of peace talks off the table entirely, with ultra-nationalists ascendant in Israel and Palestinian politics still fractured and radicalizing. The period of 2023–25 may go down as one of the most tragic and pivotal in the conflict’s modern history.

A tenuous ceasefire took hold in Gaza in late January 2025 after Hamas and Israel agreed (through mediation) to pause hostilities following international pressure ￼. By then, Gaza lay in ruins and was effectively under Israeli military administration in many areas, with Hamas’s governance crippled. Civilians trickled back to the north only to find “there is no north” – entire neighborhoods like Beit Hanoun and Rimal literally erased. Humanitarian needs were astronomical: bodies still being pulled from rubble, over 110,000 wounded needing medical care ￼, over 1.5 million Gazans homeless, and basic services virtually nonexistent. The war’s end left open questions: Who will rebuild Gaza and how? What political outcome could prevent another war? Israel insisted it could not allow Hamas to rearm or govern again; Palestinians insisted that without a broader end to the occupation and blockade, peace would remain elusive.

Humanitarian Impact: Suffering of Civilians, Children, and the Environment

Through all these chapters of conflict, ordinary people have borne the brunt. The civilian populations – both Palestinian and Israeli – have endured trauma and loss on an almost unimaginable scale. Here, we focus on the human cost: deaths and injuries, displacement, the plight of children, psychological trauma, and damage to the very fabric of life.

Casualties and Loss of Life: Since the conflict’s modern phase began around 1947, hundreds of thousands have been killed or injured. Precise totals are disputed, but to highlight a few grim milestones: the 1948 war killed an estimated 15,000 Palestinians and 6,000 Israelis ￼ ￼; the Second Intifada (2000–05) killed ~3,300 Palestinians and ~1,000 Israelis ￼; the 2014 Gaza war alone killed over 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis ￼. The recent 2023–25 war has an especially staggering toll – with over 62,000 Palestinians and roughly 1,100 Israelis killed in that period ￼ ￼. These raw numbers translate to untold individual tragedies: families erased, futures snuffed out, and communities traumatized. And deaths are only the tip of the iceberg; for every person killed, many more are left wounded or disabled. In Gaza’s 2023 war, for instance, over 111,000 were injured ￼ – overwhelming a healthcare system already on its knees.

Children in the Crossfire: Perhaps the most heart-wrenching aspect is the impact on children, who have grown up amid violence and fear. Generations of Palestinian children have known nothing but military occupation, curfews, and the threat of bombs or soldiers; many Israeli children, especially those in border areas, have spent their early years running to bomb shelters during rocket sirens. By 2021, an Israeli human rights group B’Tselem documented over 2,170 Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces since 2000, and 139 Israeli children killed by Palestinians ￼. (These figures ballooned further with the Gaza war in 2023–24, which alone killed nearly 18,000 children in Gaza ￼ and also saw Israeli children murdered on Oct 7.) Behind each statistic is a devastated family: parents grieving their lost sons and daughters, or children orphaned. The conflict has seen atrocities like the death of 4 boys playing on a Gaza beach shelled by Israel in 2014, and the murder of Israeli infants by Hamas in 2023. No child should be a target, yet thousands have been directly targeted or incidental victims. Many more have been physically maimed or psychologically scarred. Injuries like loss of limbs are common in Gaza due to explosions; some Israeli children have been permanently injured in bombings. The suffering of children has at times prompted rare moments of sympathy across the divide – for instance, when a Palestinian baby wounded in Gaza received treatment in an Israeli hospital, or when Israeli and Palestinian bereaved parents formed groups (like the Parents Circle) to mourn together and urge reconciliation.

Psychological Trauma: The conflict’s toll is not only physical. Decades of violence have inflicted deep psychological trauma on both societies. In Gaza and the West Bank, studies consistently show high levels of PTSD, anxiety, and depression among children and youth. Even before the 2023 escalation, over 50% of Gaza’s children had PTSD symptoms from prior wars and hardships ￼. After the 2023 war’s horrors, mental health experts fear virtually every surviving child in Gaza will suffer trauma; Save the Children estimated up to 21,000 children went missing or separated in the chaos between Oct 2023 and June 2024 ￼, indicating massive psychological toll on families. Gazan parents describe children who no longer speak, who cling to them terrified, or who reenact bombing scenes in their play. On the Israeli side, the perpetual threat of sudden violence has similarly marked minds. In Sderot (near Gaza), 75% of children aged 4–18 have experienced trauma symptoms like nightmares and severe anxiety ￼. After waves of rocket fire or a major attack, Israeli schools in affected areas often need extra counselors; some kids bed-wet or panic at loud noises. Inter-generational trauma is emerging: Israeli survivors of suicide bombings in the early 2000s still struggle with PTSD, just as Palestinian survivors of home demolitions or night raids carry their psychological scars. The conflict’s mental health burden is a silent crisis, with insufficient services to address it, especially in impoverished Palestinian areas. It manifests in high rates of despair, aggression, and hopelessness among youth – breeding grounds for further violence unless healed.

Displacement and Living Conditions: The conflict has repeatedly uprooted people from their homes. Palestinian displacement began en masse in 1948 (750,000 refugees) and again in 1967 (another 300,000) ￼. Those original exiles and their millions of descendants remain mostly stateless, many confined to refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, and neighboring countries. These camps – like Jabalia in Gaza or Ein al-Hilweh in Lebanon – started as tent cities and evolved into dense urban slums, characterized by poverty and overcrowding. Refugees possess little beyond UNRWA ration cards and the keys to houses that no longer exist. Within the occupied Palestinian territories, displacement continues via more subtle means: home demolitions (punitive or for lack of permits), evictions of families (as in East Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah), and land confiscation for settlements or the separation wall. The result is a constant state of insecurity – many Palestinians fear that their home could be taken or destroyed at a moment’s notice. During military operations, temporary displacement is frequent: for instance, over 400,000 Palestinians were internally displaced in Gaza during the 2014 war, sheltering in U.N. schools; in 2023–24, practically the whole population was displaced multiple times. The West Bank barrier has also effectively displaced communities, cutting villagers from their farms. In the Jordan Valley and South Hebron Hills, entire Bedouin hamlets have been demolished repeatedly by Israel, their residents forced to move.

Israeli Jews, too, have experienced displacement, albeit in different ways. In 2005, about 8,000 Israeli settlers were evacuated from Gaza settlements – many resisted and felt traumatically uprooted by their own government (though they were compensated and rehoused within Israel). Civilians near conflict zones have been evacuated for safety – e.g., Northern Israeli towns during the 2006 Lebanon war, or residents of Gaza-border communities during conflicts with Hamas. After the Oct 2023 Hamas attack, the Israeli government evacuated all Israeli communities within 4 km of Gaza, and many near Lebanon, relocating tens of thousands. While these evacuations are usually temporary and supported by the state, they nevertheless upend lives and livelihoods, and in October 2023 some Israeli villages suffered such loss of life that survivors said “we have no home to return to”. Thus, displacement is a shared aspect of suffering, though Palestinians have endured it on a far larger and more permanent scale.

Humanitarian Access and Basic Needs: One of the starkest features of the conflict is the differential access to basic necessities. In the occupied Palestinian territories, access to clean water, food, healthcare, and electricity is often severely constrained. Gaza is the clearest example: under blockade since 2007, its economy and infrastructure have withered. As of 2020, 97% of Gaza’s water was unsafe to drink due to salination and sewage contamination ￼. Residents often rely on brackish tap water or expensive tankered water. Electricity in Gaza, even before the 2023 war, was available only 8–12 hours a day on average. Hospitals have struggled with chronic shortages of medicine and equipment, a situation made far worse during wars when influxes of casualties overwhelm capacity. In some Gaza wars, doctors performed surgery on clinic floors by cellphone light. The blockade has also limited imports of fuel, cement, and other materials necessary for development – so infrastructure damaged in war is slow to rebuild (e.g., thousands remain displaced from homes destroyed in 2014 to this day). The U.N. dubbed Gaza “unliveable” by 2020 without significant change ￼, a prediction sadly realized as living conditions deteriorated sharply.

In the West Bank, conditions are relatively better than Gaza but still difficult, especially in areas under direct Israeli control (Area C). Israeli authorities control the bulk of water resources – Israeli settlements and cities get vastly more water per capita than Palestinian villages, some of which survive on as little as 20 liters per day in summer. Many rural Palestinian communities are not permitted to dig new wells; they must buy water from the Israeli company Mekorot (often at high prices) or depend on rainfall cisterns that the Israeli army sometimes destroys (claiming they were built without permits). Food insecurity is a persistent issue in Gaza, where over two-thirds of people require food aid, but also in parts of the West Bank, particularly during movement lockdowns. The humanitarian reality is that Palestinians rely heavily on international aid: UNRWA feeds and educates millions of refugees; the World Food Programme provides food vouchers to many in Gaza and West Bank; and countless NGOs operate clinics, schools, and trauma counseling centers.

During acute escalations, the denial of humanitarian access becomes life-threatening. In Gaza 2023–24, the Israeli total siege meant hospitals ran out of fuel for generators, putting premature babies and ICU patients at risk, and bakeries ran out of flour, pushing people to the brink of starvation. Aid convoys were often stalled at the Rafah crossing as bombing continued. Aid workers themselves were not spared: over 200 Palestinian and foreign humanitarian staff (including U.N. workers, doctors, and journalists) were killed during the Gaza war ￼ – a grim testament to how even those trying to alleviate suffering became victims.

Environmental Damage: The environment of Israel/Palestine – a fragile landscape of desert, hills, and coast – has not been immune to war’s ravages. Conflict has polluted land and water: for example, in Gaza, the destruction of wastewater treatment plants (whether by war or power shortages) has led to untreated sewage pouring into the Mediterranean, fouling seawater and beaches on both Gazan and Israeli coasts ￼. Bombing of industrial sites and infrastructure releases toxins; in 2023, strikes on Gaza’s sole power plant and fuel depots created dark plumes of smoke and likely contaminated soil and air with carcinogens. Agriculture has suffered immensely: Palestinian farmers often see their olive groves bulldozed (for settlement security or as punitive action). Olive trees, some centuries old, have been cut or burned – over 1 million olive trees have reportedly been uprooted in the West Bank since 1967, robbing families of income and heritage. In Gaza’s 2023 war, as noted, 68% of cropland was damaged ￼ – fields turned into craters or poisoned by munitions residue, which will impair food production for years. Water aquifers in Gaza are irreparably damaged by over-extraction and war; as early as 2017, the coastal aquifer was 96% unfit for human consumption ￼. In Israeli areas too, conflict-related environmental stress is evident – e.g., brushfires caused by incendiary balloons from Gaza burned nature reserves near the border in 2018-19; oil and chemical spills from rocket hits or military operations have local impacts.

Healthcare and Medical Challenges: Warfare and blockades have severely tested the healthcare systems. Palestinian healthcare under occupation is split – East Jerusalem has some of the best hospitals (e.g., Al-Makassed) but access is limited for West Bank/Gaza residents due to permit regimes. Many Palestinians must apply for Israeli permits to get specialized treatment in Jerusalem or abroad; these are not always granted, sometimes with deadly consequences for patients. During conflicts, moving the wounded is perilous – Red Crescent ambulances have been hit or delayed at checkpoints. In Gaza 2023, Al-Ahli hospital was hit by an explosion that killed dozens (perhaps hundreds) of civilians sheltering there, causing global horror. Later, Israeli forces surrounded and raided Al-Shifa Hospital (Gaza’s largest), alleging it concealed Hamas infrastructure – battles erupted even in the courtyards of a hospital filled with patients. Health workers describe the environment as nightmarish: performing amputations without enough anesthetic, or using vinegar to disinfect due to lack of proper supplies. The long-term health impacts are also dire – beyond trauma injuries, the conflict breeds chronic illness: children living through bombardment develop bed-wetting, speech impediments; pregnant women miscarry at higher rates due to stress; and survivors often suffer permanent disabilities with scant rehab facilities.

Collective Punishment and Human Rights: A recurring critique by human rights organizations is that both sides have engaged in actions amounting to collective punishment, exacerbating humanitarian harm. Israel’s blockade of Gaza – restricting civilians’ movement and basic goods – has been condemned as a form of collective punishment for the actions of Hamas ￼ ￼. Similarly, punitive home demolitions in the West Bank (destroying the family homes of suspected militants) leave innocent relatives homeless and fuel bitterness. For Palestinians under occupation, everyday life is circumscribed by a matrix of control: the separation wall, hundreds of checkpoints (some internal, slicing the West Bank into enclaves), and an opaque military permit system. Travel even between Palestinian towns requires navigating these hurdles; trips that should take 20 minutes can take 2 hours. In Gaza, most people (except a handful with special permits) have been unable to leave the 365 km² territory for years – essentially trapped, which is why it’s often dubbed the world’s largest “open-air prison.” This lack of freedom of movement affects everything: patients seeking healthcare, students with scholarships abroad, families split between Gaza and West Bank – all often unable to realize their basic rights. On the Israeli side, civilians have also felt besieged: waves of bus bombings made daily commutes a source of fear in the early 2000s; residents near Gaza have seconds to reach shelter for years on end; and the raw vulnerability exposed in October 2023 – when militants roamed Israeli neighborhoods for hours, killing with impunity – shattered many Israelis’ sense of security.

Human Stories and Resilience: Amid the bleakness, there are countless stories of individual resilience and compassion. Palestinian families in Gaza have opened their homes to displaced neighbors even when they themselves had little to eat. Israeli communities have rallied to support those traumatized by terror, offering communal comfort and insisting life must go on – for example, volunteers delivering supplies to families in bomb shelters, or hosting weddings and holidays in defiance of fear. In the West Bank, volunteer medics risk their lives to tend to wounded protesters; in Israel, medical crews treat victims of attacks with extraordinary professionalism (not distinguishing by nationality – Israeli hospitals routinely treat injured Palestinians as well, including many from Gaza and the West Bank in critical cases). Parents do their best to create a sense of normalcy for children: Gazan kids fly kites amid rubble; Israeli kids in Sderot paint murals on concrete bomb shelters to make them less intimidating. Such human touches highlight the yearning for normal life beneath the conflict. There are also instances of empathy bridging the divide: Bereaved Families Forums where Israeli and Palestinian parents who lost children in the conflict come together in grief and hope, or Israeli doctors who quietly coordinate with Palestinian colleagues to get kids out of Gaza for cancer treatment in Israel. These glimmers of shared humanity suggest that despite everything, many people on both sides do not want their enemy’s suffering – they simply want to live in peace and security.

In summary, the humanitarian cost of the Israel–Palestine conflict is incalculable and multi-dimensional. It is measured in lives lost and shattered; in the stunted growth of children under siege; in the empty chairs at dinner tables on both sides of the divide; in the ruins of homes and the polluted rivers; and in the psychological toll that leaves generations struggling with invisible wounds. Neither Israelis nor Palestinians have a monopoly on pain – both have experienced profound suffering, albeit in different magnitudes and contexts. But notably, the imbalance of power means Palestinian civilians, who have endured occupation, displacement, and blockade, often face the more acute and sustained deprivations. The humanitarian crisis is ongoing – in Gaza, in particular, it is an ever-present emergency. Any resolution to the conflict must reckon with healing these wounds: ensuring justice for refugees, safety for communities, and dignity and human rights for all who call this land home.

Perspectives and Narratives: Different Sides of the Story

From the foregoing history, it’s clear that Israelis and Palestinians (and their supporters) often view the same events through very different narratives – “dueling narratives” that fuel the conflict. Understanding these perspectives is crucial to grasp why the conflict is so intractable:
	•	Israeli Perspective: For many Jewish Israelis, the conflict is fundamentally about the quest for security and a national homeland. They see Israel’s establishment in 1948 as a necessary refuge after centuries of anti-Semitic persecution culminating in the Holocaust – a tiny state fighting for survival amid a hostile region ￼. In this view, the wars of 1948, 1967, 1973 were existential battles where Israel faced possible annihilation (e.g. memories of Arabs vowing to “push the Jews into the sea”). Thus, Israeli victories are seen as miraculous and defensive in nature – evidence of determination to “live free in our ancestral land”. The Palestinian refugees of 1948, while acknowledged as a humanitarian issue, are often contextualized by Israelis as a tragic outcome of a war started by the Arab side’s rejection of partition. Many Israelis believe had the Arabs accepted the U.N. plan, two states could have lived side by side and war avoided; they also note the roughly equal number of Jewish refugees from Arab lands as a sort of “population exchange” ￼.
Security concerns dominate Israeli thinking. The memory of suicide bombings in buses and cafes (during the Second Intifada) is seared into the Israeli psyche – reinforcing a narrative that whenever Israel gave Palestinians more freedom (as in Oslo), it was met with terrorism. Israelis point to Hamas rocket fire after the Gaza withdrawal in 2005 as a key example: they left Gaza entirely, only to be attacked more, suggesting to them that territorial concessions might embolden extremists rather than bring peace. Thus, many Israelis view military measures like the Gaza blockade, the West Bank barrier, and checkpoints as unfortunate but vital for self-defense. The October 2023 Hamas massacre only cemented this perspective: for a majority of Israelis, it vindicated the belief that groups like Hamas seek nothing less than their destruction, and thus Israel must use overwhelming force to ensure such horrors never recur. The settlements in the West Bank are seen by some Israelis (especially religious-nationalists) as the fulfillment of ancient Jewish birthright to Judea and Samaria, and by others as strategic buffers or bargaining chips for future negotiations. Few Israelis use the term “occupied” for the West Bank; it’s often called “disputed” or simply by its biblical names, reflecting a reluctance to see themselves as foreign occupiers on land they consider historically Jewish. On the question of Jerusalem, Israeli consensus (even among moderates) is that Jerusalem is their eternal undivided capital – they recall that from 1949–1967 Jews were barred from the Old City, and vow never to divide the city again ￼ ￼.
Israelis also frequently highlight their aspirations for peace that were allegedly spurned. They point to moments like Camp David 2000, when Israeli PM Ehud Barak offered what they believed was a far-reaching proposal (including most of West Bank and Gaza for a Palestinian state, with a foothold in East Jerusalem) which Yasser Arafat did not accept – and instead violence ensued. This feeds an Israeli narrative that “Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity,” and that their leaders prefer victimhood or maximalism (like insisting on full refugee return which Israelis see as demographic suicide) over compromise. The international bias is another theme: Israelis often feel the world unfairly singles them out, ignoring context (like Hamas storing weapons in civilian areas or using human shields) and holding Israel to unattainable standards in warfare. The U.N. is viewed with skepticism (numerous General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel are cited as one-sided). Given the long history of Jewish statelessness and betrayal by others, many Israelis default to a stance of self-reliance: “if we don’t defend ourselves, no one will.” This is encapsulated in the phrase “Ein li eretz acheret” – “I have no other country” – implying that whatever its flaws, Israel is the only guarantee against a return to Jewish powerlessness.
	•	Palestinian Perspective: For Palestinians, the conflict is fundamentally about injustice, dispossession, and resistance against colonialism. They view themselves as the indigenous people of Palestine (whether Muslim or Christian) who were thriving in cities and villages until Zionist immigration – backed by colonial powers – uprooted them. The Nakba of 1948 is the central national trauma: hundreds of villages wiped off the map, families forever exiled, a society that lost its land and political sovereignty in one blow ￼ ￼. Palestinians emphasize their narrative of ethnic cleansing, citing massacres like Deir Yassin and the systematic expulsion operations (Plan Dalet) by Zionist forces. They often contest the Israeli claim that Palestinians left voluntarily or on Arab orders, pointing to historical research (including Israeli historians like Benny Morris) that many expulsions were forcible or out of terror. Thus, Israel’s founding is seen not as a heroic independence struggle but as al-Nakba – a catastrophe built on the ruins of Palestinian lives. The legitimacy of Israel is therefore a complex and painful topic: while many Palestinians have come to accept the reality of Israel and even support a two-state compromise, the emotional narrative remains that a great wrong was done in 1948 that has never been acknowledged or remedied. The right of return for refugees (per U.N. Resolution 194) is seen as an individual human right and a sacred principle – even if only symbolic for some, Palestinians feel Israel’s blanket denial of any return is an ongoing affront to their dignity ￼.
The occupation since 1967 is viewed as a brutal military regime imposed on them. Palestinians point to the daily humiliations: soldiers barging into homes at night to arrest youths, checkpoints where workers wait for hours, settlers who can carry arms but if a Palestinian does the same he’s labeled a terrorist. They experience a system they describe as apartheid – dual legal regimes in the West Bank, one for Jewish settlers (with Israeli civilian law protecting them) and one for Palestinians (military law that permits detentions without trial and lacks basic rights). The expansive settlement enterprise, with its roads and zones off-limits to Palestinians, is seen as concrete proof that Israel has no intention of permitting a viable Palestinian state – rather, it’s “eating the land” piece by piece. Palestinians commonly refer to the West Bank as “Judaized” through settlements and to East Jerusalem’s changing demographics (Jewish settler enclaves in Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan, etc.) as a slow ethnic cleansing. Jerusalem for Palestinians is the heart of their religious and cultural identity as well – Al-Aqsa Mosque is a revered symbol (third holiest site in Islam), and they view Israeli actions there (such as police entering the mosque compound or allowing nationalist Jewish marches in the Muslim Quarter) as provocations and attempts to assert total sovereignty. The idea of East Jerusalem as their future capital is non-negotiable to them ￼ ￼.
Palestinians justify resistance “by any means necessary” as a legitimate response of an occupied people. While the international community may label groups like Hamas or Islamic Jihad as terrorists for targeting civilians, in the Palestinian discourse there is broad (though not universal) understanding of armed struggle as part of their history (much as other nations fought occupiers). That said, there are diverse views: many Palestinians were horrified by the killings of Israeli civilians on Oct 7, 2023, yet they contextualize it within the far greater number of Palestinian civilians killed by Israel over years. The asymmetry in power leads them to see their struggle as one for survival and freedom against a mighty oppressor. Gaza’s population, mostly refugee families, often say: “We have nothing to lose – we’re dying slowly under blockade, so martyrdom or risking death in protest seems as worthy as death by siege.” This desperation fuels support for actions the outside world finds extreme. Another key aspect is that Palestinians feel their plight is often marginalized globally: media focus more on Israeli fears than Palestinian suffering, in their view. They resent that Western powers who champion human rights often give Israel a pass or actively arm Israel. To them, the double standard is glaring: Israel is rarely held accountable by governments for breaking international law (e.g. settlement building despite U.N. resolutions). This breeds cynicism about peaceful diplomacy – after 30 years since Oslo, with more occupation and less land, many Palestinians, especially youth, lost faith in negotiations and turned back to resistance.
Importantly, Palestinians distinguish between anti-Zionism and anti-Jewishness. While anti-Jewish sentiment does exist in some corners (exacerbated by decades of conflict), Palestinian intellectuals and leaders often stress that their struggle is not against Judaism as a religion but against Zionism as a political movement that dispossessed them. They point out that historically, Muslim and Christian Palestinians lived alongside local Jewish communities relatively peacefully, and that Jews were part of the fabric of cities like Jerusalem before Zionism. This nuance gets lost in the fog of war, but it’s a part of the Palestinian narrative when appealing to international audiences: “We are not antisemitic, we are anti-colonial.” The humanization of their cause is crucial to them – the world often sees Palestinian militants as aggressors or terrorists, but Palestinians want the world to see them as people under siege, like the iconic image of a child with a stone facing a tank.
	•	International Observers: There are, of course, myriad other perspectives – from the broader Arab and Muslim world, where Palestine is a cause célèbre and Israeli actions are viewed through the lens of Western imperialism; to Western countries, where sympathies are often divided or politicized, sometimes seeing Israel as a democratic ally and sometimes critiquing its human rights record. The United Nations perspective emphasizes international law: that the occupation is illegal, that annexations (like East Jerusalem and Golan) aren’t recognized, that settlements violate the Geneva Conventions ￼, and that Palestinians have the right to self-determination and refugees the right of return/resettlement. Yet U.N. resolutions often go unimplemented, leading to perceptions of U.N. impotence. Human rights NGOs (Israeli, Palestinian, international) meticulously document abuses – whether it’s B’Tselem calling Israeli rule an apartheid system, or Amnesty International condemning Hamas’s rocket fire as war crimes – trying to keep focus on civilians and law. Their voice is crucial in framing the conflict not just as a dispute of narratives but as one where universal rights and laws should apply.
	•	Peace Advocates: Among both Israelis and Palestinians are peace activists who challenge their own side’s narratives to foster empathy. Groups like Breaking the Silence (Israeli ex-soldiers exposing occupation abuses) or Combatants for Peace (former fighters on both sides renouncing violence together) or Parents Circle (bereaved families forging reconciliation) carry the message that there is no military solution and that the cycle of revenge must be broken. They often stress that both peoples have legitimate rights and that acknowledging the other’s humanity and story is the only path to true peace. These voices are unfortunately marginalized in times of crisis (often labeled as traitors or normalizers by their own societies), but they keep alive an alternative narrative: one of a shared future instead of endless conflict.

In essence, the conflict persists not only on the battlefield but in the realm of memory and story. Each side’s narrative contains truths important to them: Israelis did build a nation out of the ashes of genocide and have legitimate security fears; Palestinians were unjustly displaced and have legitimate rights to freedom and land. The tragedy is that these narratives have been seen as mutually exclusive. Yet, as some historians note, this is not a zero-sum narrative; history is capable of acknowledging both the Holocaust and the Nakba as real tragedies demanding justice. As we move forward, bridging these narrative gaps – through education, dialogue, and empathy – will be as vital as any political negotiations. Without understanding and acknowledging each other’s pain and aspirations, Israelis and Palestinians will remain locked in mistrust and fear.

Conclusion: Toward a Future Beyond War

More than a century has passed since the Balfour Declaration, and over 75 years since the first Arab-Israeli war. The Israel–Palestine conflict has proven stubbornly resistant to resolution, surviving countless peace proposals and diplomatic interventions. As of 2025, the situation appears bleak: the two-state solution that the world once envisioned is hanging by a thread (if not completely unraveled on the ground), and a one-state reality of perpetual conflict or unequal rights looms. The recent conflagrations – particularly the 2023–2025 Gaza war – have deepened wounds and made reconciliation seem more distant than ever. Trust is at an all-time low; hatred and grief are pervasive.

Yet, history is not static. If there is a silver lining, it is that public discourse worldwide is increasingly recognizing the humanitarian imperative: that the status quo of occupation, blockade, and bloodshed is morally untenable and that both peoples deserve security and self-determination. There is growing acknowledgment that true peace can only come when the fundamental needs of both Israelis and Palestinians are met – Israelis’ need for guaranteed security and acceptance in the region, and Palestinians’ need for freedom, sovereignty, and justice after decades of stateless subjugation. These needs are not irreconcilable in principle; they have been reconciled in practice in peace treaties between Israel and other Arab states.

The lessons of the Oslo era, and of its collapse, loom large. Peace cannot be merely a piece of paper; it must deliver tangible improvements in people’s lives. For Palestinians, that means controlling their own destiny in their own state, an end to the occupation and settlement expansion, a just resolution for refugees (perhaps through compensation and choice of resettlement or limited return), and the ability to travel and trade freely. For Israelis, it means real assurance that a Palestinian state will live in peace alongside them, that terrorism will end, and that historic claims (like Jewish ties to Jerusalem) will be respected in some form. Hardliners on each side have long fed off the other – violence by one justifying oppression by the other – in a toxic symbiosis. Breaking that cycle requires leadership that can move past the zero-sum mentality. It also likely requires robust international involvement – not just as mediators, but perhaps peacekeepers or guarantors to address the severe trust deficit.

The humanitarian focus of this report reminds us that at its core, this conflict is about human beings, not just land or ideology. It’s about the child in Gaza who longs to play without fear of drones overhead, and the child in Sderot who longs to sleep without rocket sirens at 2 a.m. It’s about families who want to cultivate their olive groves or start businesses or worship at their holy sites without checkpoints or rockets or demolitions. It’s about the right to live a decent life – something that conflict has stolen from millions.

There is also an environmental and generational urgency: the land itself is suffering under conflict, and climate change will add pressure to water and resources. Continued strife will only make adaptation harder. The next generation, meanwhile, is watching. Young Israelis and Palestinians are connected to the world via technology as never before; many do not want to inherit a never-ending war. There are youth initiatives that bring Israelis and Palestinians together virtually to hear each other’s stories. These give a glimmer of hope that empathy can be cultivated, even in a time of walls and fire.

In a poetic sense, one might imagine the land of Israel/Palestine – so rich in history, “a land of milk and honey” in scripture – crying out for peace. The Jordan River has seen enough blood; the Mount of Olives enough tears. There is a Palestinian poet who wrote, “We suffer from an incurable disease called hope.” Even amid trauma, hope persists stubbornly among people on the ground: hope that their children might see coexistence; hope in small acts of kindness that cross enemy lines; hope that justice and peace are not incompatible dreams.

For the international reader, the Israel–Palestine conflict is a cautionary tale of how unresolved grievances and dehumanization can spiral into endless reprisals. But it’s also a testament to the resilience of the human spirit. In refugee camps and border towns, people have not given up on the concepts of home, safety, and peace. We have seen in other protracted conflicts – Northern Ireland, South Africa – that breakthroughs can and do happen, often when they are least expected.

The road to peace will require courage: Israeli and Palestinian leaders who can acknowledge the legitimacy of each other’s narrative and pain; an international community willing to uphold international law evenly; and grassroots movements that demand a better future. It will require, above all, a recognition that neither people is going away – they are destined to live together on the same small land, so they must choose whether to live in eternal conflict or in some form of partnership. As one joint Israeli-Palestinian declaration stated, “We refuse to be enemies.”

In closing, one cannot help but return to the humanitarian viewpoint: envisioning the day when children of this land – Israeli and Palestinian – can play together under the same sky, not separated by walls or fear; when memorial days for war victims cease to accumulate new names; when the Holy City of Jerusalem can truly be a city of peace, shared and cherished by all its faithful; and when two states (or whatever political arrangement grants equality and self-rule) cooperate for mutual benefit, turning their ingenuity to fighting poverty and climate change instead of each other. This may sound idealistic given the current horrors, but history has shown that even entrenched conflicts can find resolution when moral clarity and political will converge.

Until that day, the humanitarian suffering will continue to demand our attention and action. The story of the Israel–Palestine conflict is still being written – by activists on the streets, diplomats in meeting rooms, and families in their daily acts of endurance. As long as people on both sides keep alive the dream of peace and the insistence on dignity, there remains the possibility that this chapter of bloodshed can finally close, and a new chapter – of reconciliation and healing – can begin.
